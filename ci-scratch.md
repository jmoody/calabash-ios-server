## Motivation

We need to test that server can launch on the simulators.


0. pull a calabash-enabled repo from somewhere
1. make the server (install the calabash.framework)
2. try to launch
3. try to execute some cucumber

* pull calabash/calabash-ios master from github
* write the local .bundle/.config to use local gem
* install gem using rake ?

* use calabash/calabash-ios master
* 
problems - what calabash gem?  master? release?
